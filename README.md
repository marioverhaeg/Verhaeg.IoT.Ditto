# Introduction
[Eclipse Dittoâ„¢](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/) is an open source framework for creating and managing digital twins in the IoT. Verhaeg.IoT.Ditto is a small class library that wraps the Ditto websocket and REST interface and makes this usable in other projects. You can find more information on https://www.marioverhaeg.nl/tag/ditto/

# Usage

## DittoManager
DittoManager.Write(obj) accepts objects of the type "NewThing", part of the Ditto-API-2.cs file. The object is taken from the queue and updated to Ditto. The DittoManager is a singleton class that you need to start with the correct parameters: the Ditto URI, username, and password.

Example:
```c#
NewThing t = new NewThing();
t.Definition = "Verhaeg.IoT.Energy:forecast:1.0.0";

// Create attributes
Attributes ats = new Attributes();
ats.AdditionalProperties.Add("name", "Verhaeg.IoT.Energy.Forecast:x");

DittoManager.Instance().Write(t);
```
(note that the "name" attribute should meet the specifications of a ThingId: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-specification-things.html)

## DittoWebSockerManager
The DittoWebSocketManager connects to the Ditto websocket and subscribes to the events based on the ns parameter. The formatting of the ns parameter is described on the Ditto website: https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/httpapi-protocol-bindings-websocket.html

The example below will subscribe to all events:
```
START-SEND-EVENTS
```
The example below will subscribe to selected events of a specific thingId:
```
START-SEND-EVENTS?filter=like(thingId,\"Verhaeg.IoT.Host:Chromecast\")
```
You inherit the DittoWebSockerManager in another class to capture its events. Example:
```c#
public class Host : DittoWebSocketManager
{
  public Host() : base("START-SEND-EVENTS?filter=like(thingId,\"Verhaeg.IoT.Host:Chromecast\")", "Ditto_Chromecast")
  {
    
  }
  public override void SendToManager(string str)
  {
    // str contains the Ditto event
  }
}
```
